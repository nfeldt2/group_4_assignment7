Narrative: This game is a one player game similar to agar.io. The user can control their circle by moving the mouse and having the circle follow it. When a circle is engulfed by the user a new circle is spawned in. The game is won when a circle has a very large size and the game is lost if the user is engulfed. 

Nathan: I implemented the splitting circle functionality using of the UserCircle class as well as the Circle and Food class. The circle class being the base class for the UserCircle class, implemented grow on touching food and growing on engulfing another circle. The Splitting circle functionality causes the original circle to split in two circle. The "ejected" circle shoots towards the direction of the mouse and is lerped back to its proper speed (speed is determined by the size of the circle). Additionally both the "ejected" circle and the "original" circle still follow the mouse which mean they are still both controlled by the user.  

Abraham: I implemented the movement in the UserCircle class as well as most of the main pde. The movement is a basic lerp function that has the player circle follow the mouse. Additionally, we made the circle blue in order to stand out among the rest of the enemies. I also altered the food to be green for visibility against mines. Lastly, I implemented the UI, which includes some overlay information that includes a timer for how long you have been alive. This was going to be a class, but due to only needing the feature once, it was instead built in. The UI will disappear when the player dies to signify the death.
