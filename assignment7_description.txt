Nathan: I implemented the splitting circle functionality using of the UserCircle class as well as the Circle and Food class. The circle class being the base class for the UserCircle class, implemented grow on touching food and growing on engulfing another circle. The Splitting circle functionality causes the original circle to split in two circle. The "ejected" circle shoots towards the direction of the mouse and is lerped back to its proper speed (speed is determined by the size of the circle). Additionally both the "ejected" circle and the "original" circle still follow the mouse which mean they are still both controlled by the user.
